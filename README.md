# DNS Server in JavaScript (Node.js)

This project is a lightweight and customizable DNS server built using Node.js and the `dgram` module. It handles DNS requests and provides responses according to specified configurations, offering basic DNS server functionality for local or experimental use.

## Features
- **Lightweight**: Uses Node.js's built-in networking libraries to manage DNS queries efficiently.
- **Customizable**: Easily configurable for specific DNS rules and behaviors.
- **UDP Support**: Handles DNS requests using UDP (User Datagram Protocol) via the `dgram` module.
- **Educational**: Serves as a learning tool for understanding how DNS servers work at a low level.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: Provides the runtime for building and running the server.
- **JavaScript**: Core programming language used for the project.
- **dgram**: Node.js module used to implement UDP communication for DNS queries.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v12 or higher)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chandankrsah09/dns-server-js.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Server
1. Start the DNS server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
2. The server will begin listening for DNS queries on the specified port.

### Configuration
You can modify the DNS server's configuration (e.g., custom domain resolutions, logging) in the `config.js` file.
